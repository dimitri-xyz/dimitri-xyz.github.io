I attended the [University of Brasilia](http://www.unb.br/) where I graduated with a Bachelor&#8217;s Degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering. After working in the industry for a couple of years, I joined the State University of Campinas, [UNICAMP](http://www.unicamp.br/), also in Brazil. There I completed a master&#8217;s in the same field. Finally, I received a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu) from [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu) in March 2008 working under the guidance of Profs. [Felix Wu](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/%7Ewu) and [Karl Levitt](http://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/levitt/).ï»¿

I am very proud to have placed first of all 9500 candidates at the university admission exam (vestibular) for the University of Brasilia &#8211; UnB.
